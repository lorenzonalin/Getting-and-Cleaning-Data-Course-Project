# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains the project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

## Files

- `run_analysis.R`: Script to perform the analysis.
- `tidy_data.txt`: The resulting tidy dataset.
- `CodeBook.md`: Describes the variables, data, and transformations.
- `README.md`: This file.

## How to run the script

1. Place `run_analysis.R` in your R working directory.
2. Run the script using the command `source("run_analysis.R")`.
3. The script will download, unzip, and process the data, creating a tidy dataset saved as `tidy_data.txt`.
